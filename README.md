Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised histologically by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of Lewy bodies in various parts of the brain. Therefore, this work designed an advanced CNN model to predict Pd from both image and voice data.
